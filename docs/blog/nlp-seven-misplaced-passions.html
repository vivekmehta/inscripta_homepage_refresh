                            <div class="blog blog-text">For the past two years, we, at Inscripta AI, have been working with organizations looking to integrate NLP/AI into their workflows and solutions (“Fast-tracking AI Integration” is our mission!). This article is a brief summary of our observations on some common client misperceptions with respect to recent developments in NLP, especially the use of large-scale models and datasets. As such, these points are relevant primarily to business contexts where AI integration is in its early stages, and not to research projects, or situations where it is a mature component of the solution. A better appreciation of these issues, we believe, can significantly improve the chances of successful AI implementation in businesses, whether executed in-house or outsourced.</div>

                                With deep learning, and the transformers revolution (BERT, GPT, etc.), off-the-shelf models are substantially better than they were around 5 years ago. The threshold for business viability is therefore breached more often. Nevertheless, in our experience, these models can almost always be substantially improved for a specific business problem (
                                <a class="blog" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07574" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">a recent example from an ethical NLP paper by Jiang et al.</a>
                                ). Clients often ask us whether we have a BERT solution (a decade ago, it used to be statistical or Bayesian models), and whether we could quickly try it on their problem: “Does BERT work on this problem? Yes or no?”. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a premature “no” when the answer may well have been “yes”, with a few weeks’ effort. BERT by itself is no panacea, and transformers are not a competitive advantage. Moreover, deploying such models without the right safeguards may even lead to disastrous consequences, as when a GPT-3-based chatbot told a mock patient to kill himself, leading Yann LeCun to
                                <a class="blog" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/godfather-ai-trashed-gpt3" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">comment</a>

                                Transfer-learning and cross application of large prebuilt models lead to faster system development and deployment. However, the base models are often trained on tasks slightly different from the target application, resulting in lower accuracies. For instance,
                                <a class="blog" href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.99.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">recent research) recent research</a>
                                shows that large NLI models that are commonly used for classification depend on spurious patterns, which may impede real-world performance. Another common scenario we encounter is where the business workflow requires near-100% recall at an extraction or search task with best possible precision, or vice-versa, and the off-the-shelf model is tuned on a different metric (say, F1), again resulting in poor task performance. Domain experts and NLP specialists should work together, fairly early in the project, on developing a metric that is suitable to the task at hand.

                                The incremental value of training data is uncertain. Collecting and annotating a lot of data haphazardly and uncritically (“take it as it comes” from the internet), or simply amassing historical and potentially irrelevant data, might sometimes produce passable results. Nonetheless, a keen eye to the

                                of collected data and the effectiveness of planned annotation is crucial to avoiding useless data collection. In one instance, we discovered that a poorly performing helpdesk chatbot had arbitrary conversational data from movie scripts and the Ubuntu dialogue dataset as part of its training data (We suspect the chatbot “frankly didn’t give a damn” about user problems). Other problems that emanate from

                                Experimenting with different data, adapting business workflows or exploring the space of viable business solutions (using some technique that works reasonably well) is often more potent than spending too much time on the basic techniques or models used.

                                research shows how rethinking data and process can be effective. A caricature but mostly true: Once a problem is formulated and benchmark data is established, workflow and data are held constant while technique is experimented with (e.g., most research work), while at the beginning of an NLP/AI pilot or integration, it is useful to think of technique as fixed and data/processes as variable (Listen to

We are often asked to estimate the accuracy of our baseline model right at the outset, when it is not clear that the available test data is good enough for a reliable evaluation. For instance, we were once asked to measure the accuracy of a sentiment classifier on test data where annotator disagreement turned out to be over 20%.
